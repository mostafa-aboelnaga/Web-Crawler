## üòé **Quick start**

<br>

First, [download](https://go.dev/dl/) and install **Go**.

Next, make sure you are in the directory of one of the two methods, `parallel_web_crawler_using_channels` or `parallel_web_crawler_using_classic_locks`.

## Then just run the following:

<br>

To crawl using channels           |  To crawl using classic locks
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
run --> `crawler_channels_implementation.go`  |  run --> `crawler_locks_implementation.go`

---
<br>

## using the following commands:

<br>

```bash
go run crawler_channels_implementation.go
```
## or
```bash
go run crawler_locks_implementation.go
```
<br>

## That's all you need to know to start! ‚úÖ

## Note
### I have used a fake fetcher, that implements a simplified version of the `golang.org` website, but it would also work if used with the real web given the right conditions/setup.
